# Grocery Price Tracker (2014-2025)

This project explores historical grocery prices and fits a multiple linear regression model to predict future trends using the `all_products_merged.csv` dataset.

## Data
- `all_products_merged.csv` contains monthly observations, economic indicators, and product identifiers from 2014–2025.
- Predictions for December 2025 are saved to `december_2025_predictions.csv` when the full analysis pipeline is executed.
- Generated plots (e.g., `mlr_stratified_results.png`) and CSV outputs provide a quick view of model performance and predicted prices.
