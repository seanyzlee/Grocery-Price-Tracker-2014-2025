## 🔬 Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

The dataset contains 10,908 observations with the following key variables:
- **Economic Indicators**: CPI (Consumer Price Index), Fuel Prices
- **Temporal Data**: Month/Year combinations, Holiday indicators
- **Product Information**: 108 unique food products across categories
- **Target Variable**: Price per unit

### Feature Engineering

The enhanced model incorporates 40 carefully engineered features:

#### Economic Features
- CPI and Fuel Price interactions
- Economic stress indicators
- Inflation-adjusted pricing metrics

#### Product Categorization
- Meat, Dairy, Vegetable, Fruit classifications
- Premium product indicators
- Product complexity metrics (length, word count)

#### Temporal Features
- Seasonal indicators (Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall)
- Holiday season markers
- Time trend analysis

#### Historical Statistics
- Product-specific average prices
- Category-based price distributions
- Price volatility measures

### Model Architecture

**Primary Model**: Random Forest Regressor
- **Cross-validation**: 5-fold stratified by month-year combinations
- **Feature Selection**: 40 engineered features
- **Regularization**: Built-in feature importance weighting

**Baseline Comparison**: Linear Regression with basic features
- Used for performance comparison
- Demonstrates improvement from feature engineering

## 📈 Key Results

### Most Important Features (Random Forest)
1. **Price_inflation_adj** (98.99%) - Inflation-adjusted pricing
2. **Time_trend** (0.32%) - Temporal patterns
3. **CPI** (0.19%) - Economic indicators
4. **Economic_stress** (0.11%) - Combined economic pressure

### December 2025 Price Predictions

**Top 10 Most Expensive Products:**
- Infant formula: $49.00
- Beef strip loin cuts: $33.76
- Beef rib cuts: $29.85

## 🚀 Usage

### Running the Enhanced Model

```python
# Initialize and run the enhanced analysis
from realistic_enhanced_mlr import RealisticEnhancedMLR

analyzer = RealisticEnhancedMLR()
results = analyzer.run_complete_realistic_analysis('all_products_merged.csv')

# Generate future predictions
predictions = analyzer.predict_future_prices_realistic('December', 2025)
```

### Running the Baseline Model

```python
# For comparison with baseline approach
from food_mlr import StratifiedMLR

mlr_analyzer = StratifiedMLR()
results = mlr_analyzer.run_complete_analysis('all_products_merged.csv')
```

## 📊 Data Sources

The dataset includes:
- **Time Period**: April 2017 - September 2024
- **Products**: 108 food items across all major categories
- **Economic Data**: Monthly CPI and fuel price indicators
- **Seasonal Data**: Holiday month indicators

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Stratification Strategy

The model uses month-year combinations for stratification to ensure:
